# Student-Exercise-Prototype
This repo has code that contains a prototype of a web app that standardizes exercise routine for a student. This is a game that simulates an exercise and instructs the student through a textarea on how to proceed further. Student would have to start the exercise again in order to attempt the exercise another time.
